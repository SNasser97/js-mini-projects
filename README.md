## Current Projects to date

#### Weather search /w OpenWeatherAPI
<p>Uses the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve weather location data. This mini project provides displaying the search results as well as displaying the current location selected when making a query. I have used the REST countries API to display the corresponding country flag by passing the retrieved ISO code from the weather api </p>

#### Contacts filter
<p>The contacts that are provided are randomly generated from a function containg a list of names. Searching for a name will display only that contact/section e.g. J => John Doe (555)-5555</p>
